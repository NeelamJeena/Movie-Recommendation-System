# Movie-Recommendation-System Using Machine Learning

This is one of the most important application of machine learning which we need to be aware of.
Here,we have build a system in which the user will give the name of his favourite movie and based on this input we will recommend certain movies to him.

So,all of us are familiar with the ott platforms like netflix,amazon prime video and disney+hotstar.In the recent years these platforms have been used extensively by a lot of people.The main reason behind this is that these platforms know the kind of movies each user likes.These platforms try to analyze the user's watching patterns and try to recommend movies to the users based on their past choices and behaviour.These platforms are able to do this because they have their own recommendation systems.
